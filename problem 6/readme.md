Fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and then 1 follows. All subsequent values are the sum of the previous two, ex: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. Complete the fibonacci() function, which has an index, n (starting at 0), as a parameter and returns the nth value in the sequence. Any negative index values should return -1.

Ex: If the input is:

     7

the output is:

    fibonacci(7) is 13
